notes: This is legit one of the greatest movies of all time, the only problem I see (looking back almost 40 years later) is that Venkman is a fucking creep. I mean, his character is not inaccurate, so it's not poorly written, but it's a bit of a trope and then he ends up being less of a hero in my eyes. Still it is an absolutely fine-ass piece of cinema. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll GASP at all the GHOSTS!
