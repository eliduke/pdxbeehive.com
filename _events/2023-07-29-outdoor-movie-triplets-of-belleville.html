notes: This is definitely one of my favorite animated movies. It's so strange, creepy, hilarious, and beautifully animated. Also, the old-timey trio songs really get my toes-a-tappin'. By the end of the movie you'll be just as excited as I am to hop on your bike and pedal your lil heart out for the <a href="https://www.shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-17490">Pedalpalooza Rooftop Ride</a>! The ride meets anytime after 10:45pm and departs at 11:22pm, so ride your bike to the beehive and roll out with us once the movie is over.
