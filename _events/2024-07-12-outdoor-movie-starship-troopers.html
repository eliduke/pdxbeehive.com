notes: This movie is truly amazing. On the surface, it's an action-packed shoot-em-up movie in space with giant bugs exploding all over the place. Just below the surface, it's a glorious satire criticizing militarism and propaganda. It uses over-the-top military propaganda and Nazi-like symbolism to highlight the dangers of extremism. Let's GOOOOOO!!
