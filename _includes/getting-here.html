  <p>As you can see, the address is on Killingsworth but the house is one back on the north side of the street down a little unmarked driveway. You can trust Google and Apple Map directions, so just follow along and you'll be just fine.</p>

  <h3>Parking</h3>

  <p>Parking is very limited around the house. If you've been told to take one of the off-street spots in front of the house, go for it! Grab an open one, but be aware that sometimes backing in can be the easier option. Just throwing that out there!</p>
  <p>Otherwise, you might be able to find some on spots Killingsworth. If not, there should be plenty on 52nd Ave, south of Killingsworth. There's a good-sized residential area there with lots of street parking, but you might have to walk a block or two.</p>
