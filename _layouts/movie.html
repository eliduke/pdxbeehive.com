  <p>Outdoor Movies at The Beehive are fun and casual. We set up a projector in the backyard, put out some chairs, lay out blankets, bust out some snacks and drinks, and then the party starts itself!</p>

  <p><strong>Feel free to bring anything that you want to contribute</strong>: food, drinks, lawn chairs, blankets, and other friends! Seriously, the more the merrier! We'll have some of that stuff available, but if you're particular about something, make it happen. There will be cooler space with ice for you to add cold drinks and a table or two for setting up snacks. Try your best to bring finger foods because who's got time to wash a bunch of plates and shit, amiright?</p>

  <h3>Getting Here</h3>

  <p>Things are a little bit weird with the house and the address and <strong>stupid</strong> Google Maps, but we get ahead of ourselves. First, you need the address:</p>

  <p class="time">
    5133 NE Killingsworth St<br/>
    Portland, OR 97218<br/><br/>
    <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?q=5133+NE+Killingsworth+St+Portland+OR+97218" target="_blank">Apple Maps</a> â€¢
    <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=5133+NE+Killingsworth+St+Portland+OR+97218" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>
  </p>

  <p>As you can see, the address is on Killingsworth, but the house is one back on the north side of the street down a little driveway. The address shows up correctly on Google and Apple Maps, but if you use Google Maps directions it will tell you to turn down the wrong driveway and lead you totally astray! It's frustrating, let me tell you. Apple Maps directions will tell exactly (and correctly!) where to go. If Google Maps is your only option, you're better off just pulling up the address and then driving/walking toward it. Do not trust the directions! Also, according to Google Maps, you access my house from NE 50th Place, even though that's not actually a city street.</p>

  <h3>Parking</h3>

  <p>Parking is very limited around the house. You might be able to find some on Killingsworth. If not, then there will most likely be plenty on 52nd, south of Killingsworth. There's a good-sized residential area there with lots of street parking, but you might have to walk a block or two.

  <h3>Accessibily</h3>

  <p>Outdoor movies at the Beehive happen in the backyard. When you arrive you'll see five off-street parking spaces in front of the house, and the one closest to the mailbox is a wider, 10-foot spot which could be reserved! Let us know if that would be helpful. From the parking area, there is a partially accessible sidewalk (a little narrow at one point) toward the front door where there are two stairs up to the front porch with a handrail on the left. If you keep going straight passed the front door there are 2 more steps down with a handrail on the left that leads to another section of concrete sidewalk. Once you go around the house into the back yard there are some uneven grassy areas with a few more sections of concrete sidewalk here and there. There are 3 steps up to the backporch (with a left handrail) which is the main level of the house where the kitchen, dining room, living room, and both bathrooms are. The half bathroom is tiny and not accessible at all, the full bath is spacious but it's a tight around the actual toilet.</p>
