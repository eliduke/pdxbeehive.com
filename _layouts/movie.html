  <p><strong>Outdoor Movies at The Beehive are casual and fun</strong>. We set up a projector in the backyard, put out some chairs, lay out blankets, bust out some snacks and drinks, and then the party starts itself!</p>

  <p><strong>Feel free to bring anything that you want to contribute</strong>: food, drinks, lawn chairs, blankets, and other friends! Seriously, the more the merrier! We'll have some of that stuff available, but if you're particular about something, make it happen. There will be cooler space with ice for you to add cold drinks and a table or two for setting up snacks. Try your best to bring finger foods because who's got time to wash a bunch of plates and shit, amiright?</p>

  <h3>Accessibily</h3>

  <p>Outdoor movies at the Beehive happen in the backyard. When you arrive you'll see five off-street parking spaces in front of the house, and the one closest to the mailbox is a wider, 10-foot spot which could be reserved! Let us know if that would be helpful. From the parking area, there is a partially accessible sidewalk (a little narrow at one point) toward the front door where there are two stairs up to the front porch with a handrail on the left. If you keep going straight passed the front door there are 2 more steps down with a handrail on the left that leads to another section of concrete sidewalk. Once you go around the house into the back yard there are some uneven grassy areas with a few more sections of concrete sidewalk here and there. There are 3 steps up to the backporch (with a left handrail) which is the main level of the house where the kitchen, dining room, living room, and both bathrooms are. The half bathroom is tiny and not accessible at all, the full bath is spacious but it's a tight around the actual toilet.</p>
