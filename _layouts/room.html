  <h3>The Neigborhood</h3>
  <p>It's a 10-minute walk to all the lovely goings-on at 42nd (Ole Frijole, Nepo 42, The Spare Room, Old Salt, Miss Zumstein Coffee Shop, a #75 bus stop, etc); a 5-minute walk to the new Kʰunamokwst Park on Alberta; a 20-minute walk to New Seasons, the Kennedy School, and all that Alberta has to offer; a 12-minute drive to the airport for easy pick-up and drop-off; and a 30-minute bike ride to downtown. There's also a #72 bus stop just down the street from the house.</p>

  <h3>The Right Fit</h3>
  <p>We're all pretty darn laid back and friendly, if we don't say so ourselves. Some work early, others stays up late, but the house quiet hours are generally from about 10pm to 8am and everyone is very respectful of one another's needs, space, and schedules. Sometimes we have outdoor movie parties in the backyard, sometimes we're straight chillin', and sometimes we're out partying until 4am last Friday night in our booty shorts!</p>
  <p>We aren't a "chore wheel" kind of house, but we like folks that take ownership of their space and invest a little in the everday goings-on. If something is a little dirty, clean it up! If something seems broken, try to fix it! In the very least, let others know so that we can all take care of each other. We don't do house meetings, but we end up hanging in the kitchen and catching up with each other pretty regularly and arrange occassional game / movie nights. We also have a group chat that we use for little updates, questions, and LOLz. We are an open communication kinda place. :)</p>
  <p>We are looking for someone of any gender, any sexuality, any <em>anything</em> that wants to jump in and have fun with this. You're welcome to have your homies over and we'll have our homies over and we can all be one happy family, but it's also totally cool if you want to do your own thing and throw out a high five on your way out the door, just don't leave us hangin'!</p>
  <p>Send us an email with a little bit about yourself and we'll be in touch.</p>
