<h3>The Charcoal Room</h3>

<img class="img-rounded img-responsive charcoal-hero" src="/images/rentals/charcoal-room/charcoal-room-1.jpg" />

<p>The Charcoal Room (named for its accent wall) is on the ground floor in the northwest corner of the house. It has two newer windows facing west and north, a good-sized closet, new-ish carpet, and blackout curtains. It is nestled between the bathroom and the Lavendar Room (the other rental room on the ground floor). Due to it's proximaty to the bathroom, you will probably hear some muffled showers being taken and toilets being flushed, so it's not great for <em>super</em> light sleepers.</p>
