<h2 class="text-center">Furnished Room for Rent!</h2>

<p>We've got a month-to-month, furnished room available <strong>August 15th</strong> at The Beehive in NE Portland / Cully neighborhood (near NE 52nd and Killingsworth St). Maybe you're in a tight spot and you need a place to crash for a couple months? Awesome. Maybe you're in-between some travels and need a place in Portland for the fall/winter? Totally cool. Or, maybe you're pumped about a sweet, long-term place! All of that sounds great to us.</p>

<h3>The Quick and Dirty</h3>

</ul>

<h3>The Room</h3>

<p>The Green Room (named for its accent wall) is one of two bedrooms on the second floor of the house. It's very spacious (~165 square feet) and has two new west-facing windows, a massive closet with a full-size guest bed, wall-mounted electric heater, ceiling fan, AC unit, and LED lighting with remote control. Due to it's location directly above the bathroom, you might hear some muffled showers being taken and toilets being flushed. It's petty mellow, but it's not great for <em>super duper</em> light sleepers.</p>
