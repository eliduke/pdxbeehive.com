    <dt>How does the heat work?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The heat is two-fold: a gas furnace in the basement and wall-mounted electric heaters in each of the bedrooms.</p>
      <h3>Gas Furnace</h3>
      <p>The gas furnace is controlled by the Nest thermostat in the living room.</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/heat-nest.jpg" />
      <p>When you first walk up to the Nest, it will probably show you the time. Push lightly anywhere on the device to bring up the current temperature / heating status in the house. The picture above is showing you two different scenarios. On the left it shows that the temperature inside the house is 66 degrees and the Nest is set at 66 degrees, so the heat is off. On the right it shows that the temperature inside the house is 65 degrees and the Nest is set at 68 degrees, so the heat is on! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Turning the Nest to the right or left will raise or lower the temperature, respectively.</p>
      <p>The good news is that you shouldn't need to adjust the temperature in the house very often because we have a super sweet heating schedule already in place.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Nest heating schedule in Celcius</p>
      </span>
      <p>The schedule is a best-guess for comfort and efficiency, but it depends on the combination of all of our schedules. If there is any part of it you'd like to change or adjust, definitely let us know.</p>
      <p>In general we don't have the furnace heat super high because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>it's hard to know exactly when people will be home to actually use the warmth</li>
        <li>it's winter time and it's reasonable to wear a sweater</li>
        <li>you have a heater in your room that you can set however you like (more on that later)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, if you're ever chilling at home and watching a movie in the living room or eating dinner in the kitchen and it's just too darn cold, don't hesitate to zip over to the Nest and turn it up a bit. No problem. Once you've turned it up, the Nest will show you how long it will stay at that temp, which is an important detail. For example:</p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          If it's 8pm on a Tuesday and you turn the heat up to 68 degrees, the Nest will tell you that it will stay there until 11pm (the next scheduled change in temp). But, if it's 11:30pm on a Tuesday and you turn the heat up to 68 degrees, the Nest will tell you that it will stay there until 5:30am the next morning!
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>The heat would stay at 68 degrees all through the night, so in that case be sure to turn the heat back down before you go to bed.</p>
      <h3>Electric Heaters</h3>
      <p>The wall-mounted electric heaters are <em>much more</em> self explanatory. There's a power button and a temperature dial. They are a slow heat, which means they take about an hour to really get going, but they are also much more efficient than lots of other electric heaters out there.</p>
      <p>A couple more things to keep in mind for their daily use:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>keep your door closed when you have the heater on</li>
        <li>turn the heater off when you leave the house</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We have found that a good pattern to follow can be to turn the heater on when you get home in the evening and then turn it off when you go to bed. The built-up heat in the room will last until you're asleep, all warm and toasty under the covers, and then the house heat will kick on in the morning.</p>
      <p>Quick note: when you turn the heater on for the first time after it's been off all summer, it will smell a little funky for a little bit as it burns off all the dust that has built-up inside.</p>
      <h3>But in the end...</h3>
      <p>We want you to be comfortable! So, do what you need to do. We just don't want to burn what we're not using or keep the heat cranked up while we walk around in our underwear all winter. I mean, that does sound really nice, but you get the idea. If something still feels off or you're just too darn cold, please let us know so that we can help figure it out.</p>

    <span id="printer"><hr /></span>
    <dt>Can I use the printer?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Yes you can! Well, probably. Actually, it depends.</p>
      <p>The printer is connected to the wifi network in the house, but, due to lots of boring technical reasons, you can only print wirelessly if you have an Apple device: MacBook, iPhone, iPad, etc. We have tried a couple times to connect non-Apple computers and phones wirelessly, and it was a long, drawn-out process that eventually ended in failure. However, if it's an emergency, you can plug the printer's USB cable directly into your laptop and print away! It's just a bit more awkward and not nearly as fun. I don't think it's possible to print directly from an Android phone.</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/printer-closet.jpg" />
      <p>The printer is located on the top shelf in the hall closet. It's <em>nothing</em> fancy, but it'll get the job done if you need to print a shipping label, an insurance card, or what-have-you. We only stock black ink and super basic paper, so if you need some sort of a fancy color job, you'll have to find another option.</p>
      <h3>Print from iOS</h3>
      <img class="printer-pro" src="/images/faq/printer-pro-icon.png" />
      <p>This requires buying the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/printer-pro/id393313223" target="_blank">Printer Pro iOS App</a> for $6.99. There might be other apps out there that work just as well, but this one has been so reliable that I can't help but recommend it. I realize it seems a little steep for a stupid little printing app, but it works perfectly and has saved me a bunch of time not having to email a document to myself and then opening it on my computer and then printing and blah blah blah.</p>
      <h3>Print from MacBook</h3>
      <p>First you will need to add the printer to your computer. To do that, open <em>System Preferences</em> and click on "Printers &amp; Scanners".</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/printer-add-0.png" />
      <p class="text-center">Click on the little + in the bottom left corner.</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/printer-add-1.png" />
      <p class="text-center">Click on the "hp deskjet 5600" printer in the list. It should highlight blue.</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/printer-add-2.png" />
      <p>At the bottom of the window you should see some stuff happening. Once the "Add" button is clickable, click it! There might be a few more little windows but just keep clicking OK until you are back at "Printers &amp; Scanners" in <em>System Preferences</em>.</p>
      <img class="img-rounded img-fluid" src="/images/faq/printer-add-3.png" />
      <p>You should see the printer in the list now! And you should also see that printer as an available option anytime you want to print something from your computer. From here on out just click print and then go double check in the closet to make sure that it's moving along just fine.
