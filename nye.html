  <h1>LET'S GOOOOO!</h1>

  <p>Some of you may remember the absolute banger from last year, some of you maybe only heard (saw?) stories. Long story short, this is gonna be a special occasion and you DO NOT wanna miss it. Good news though if you are reading this then YOU are invited and encouraged to tell your friends.</p>

  <p><em>The more the merrier!</em></p>

  <p>This lil shindig is gonna be an <b>old-school, classic house party</b> (remember those?!) with some karaoke, a dance party or two, a chill zone in the basement with darts, and a backyard hangout space with a wood stove (and chocolate chip pancakes!) to help keep people warm. It's gonna be wild and fun, and it'll probably go deep into the wee hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>Please read all the words below (at least once) before asking any follow-up questions!</p>

  <p>The party will officially begin at 6pm, and you are more than welcome to arrive fashionably early to enjoy a mellower situation before it really pops off. The karaoke will begin whenever people want it to, so if you want some practice runs you gotta show up early!</p>

  <h3>GETTING HERE</h3>

  <img class="img-responsive getting-here" src="/images/directions-map.png">

  <p>As you can see, the address is on Killingsworth but the house is one back on the north side of the street down a little unmarked driveway. You can trust Google and Apple Map directions, so just follow along and you should be fine.</p>

  <h3>PARKING</h3>

  <p>Parking is very limited around the house. You might be able to find some on Killingsworth. If not, then there will most likely be some on 52nd St south of Killingsworth. There's a good-sized residential area there with lots of street parking, but you will probably have to walk a block or two.

  <h3>WHAT TO BRING</h3>

  <p>We will have a variety of drinks and snacks available, but probably not enough for everyone so you should consider bringing something for yourselves and maybe some extra to share! There will be lots of fridge space available to keep things cool, and we can definitely fire up the oven for some frozen pizzas when the late-night munchies hit. The wood stove in the backyard will be rocking most of the night and we'll have a cast iron pan available for frying up some delicious lil treats. Last year someone brought ingredients to make polenta and it was a real crowd pleaser at 1am!</p>

  <p>There will definitely be inside and outside time at this party so be sure to bring a warm jacket for the outside times. We'll have the wood stove going, but if you must be warm and toasty at all times then a jacket is a good idea.</p>

  <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

  <p>When you arrive you'll see five off-street parking spaces right in front of the house, and the one closest to the mailbox is a wider, 10-foot spot which could be reserved! Let us know if that would be helpful for you. From the parking area, there is a partially accessible sidewalk (a little narrow at one point) toward the front door where there are two stairs up to the front porch with a handrail on the left. If you keep going straight passed the front door there are 2 more steps down with a handrail on the left that leads to another section of concrete sidewalk. Once you go around the house into the back yard there are some uneven grassy areas with another  large section of uneven concrete sidewalk all the way to the back door. There are 2 steps up to the back door porch/landing (with a handrail on the left) which is the same level of the house where the kitchen, dining room, living room, and both bathrooms are. The half bathroom is tiny and not accessible at all, the full bath is spacious but it's a bit tight around the actual toilet.</p>
