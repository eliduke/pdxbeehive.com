  <h1>It's Party Time at the Beehive once again!</h1>

  <p>We're throwing another party to ring in the New Year. Some of you may remember that the last one of these was in the <em>before times</em> and here we are again. This is a special occasion! If you are reading this then YOU are invited and encouraged to tell your friends. The more the merrier! It's gonna be a <em>classic</em> house party with some karaoke, a dance party or two, a chill zone in the basement with darts, and a backyard hangout space with a wood stove (and chocolate chip pancakes!) to help keep people warm. It's gonna be wild and fun, and it'll probably go deep into the wee hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>Please read all the words below (at least once) before asking any follow-up questions!</p>

  <h3>DETAILS</h3>

    <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?q=5133+NE+Killingsworth+St+Portland+OR+97218" target="_blank">Apple Maps</a> â€¢
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5133+NE+Killingsworth+St,+Portland,+OR+97218" target="_blank">Google Maps</a><br>
  </p>

  <p>The party will officially begin at 6pm, and you are more than welcome to arrive fashionably early to enjoy a mellower situation before it really pops off. The karaoke will begin whenever people want it to, so if you want some practice runs you gotta show up early!</p>

  <h3>GETTING HERE</h3>

  <p>Things are a little bit weird with the house and the address and <strong>stupid</strong> Google Maps.</p>
  <p>So, the address is on Killingsworth, but the house is one back on the north side of the street down a little driveway. The address shows up correctly on Google and Apple Maps, but if you use Google Maps directions it will tell you to turn down the wrong driveway and lead you totally astray! It's frustrating, let me tell you. Apple Maps directions will tell exactly (and correctly) where to go. If Google Maps is your only option, you're better off just pulling up the address and then driving/walking toward it. Don't trust the directions. Also, according to Google Maps, you access my house from NE 50th Place, even though that's not actually a city street.</p>

  <h3>PARKING</h3>

  <p>Parking is very limited around the house. You might be able to find some on Killingsworth. If not, then there will most likely be some on 52nd south of Killingsworth. There's a good-sized residential area there with lots of street parking, but you will probably have to walk a block or two.

  <h3>WHAT TO BRING</h3>

  <p>We will have a variety of drinks and snacks available, but probably not enough for everyone so you should consider bringing something for yourselves and maybe some extra to share! There will be lots of fridge space available to keep things cool, and we can definitely fire up the oven for some frozen pizzas when the late-night munchies hit.</p>
  <p>There will definitely be inside and outside time at this party so be sure to bring a warm jacket for the outside times. We'll have the wood stove going, but if you must be warm and toasty at all times then a jacket is a good idea.</p>

  <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

  <p>When you arrive you'll see five off-street parking spaces right in front of the house, and the one closest to the mailbox is a wider, 10-foot spot which could be reserved! Let us know if that would be helpful for you. From the parking area, there is a partially accessible sidewalk (a little narrow at one point) toward the front door where there are two stairs up to the front porch with a handrail on the left. If you keep going straight passed the front door there are 2 more steps down with a handrail on the left that leads to another section of concrete sidewalk. Once you go around the house into the back yard there are some uneven grassy areas with another  large section of uneven concrete sidewalk all the way to the back door. There are 2 steps up to the back door porch/landing (with a handrail on the left) which is the same level of the house where the kitchen, dining room, living room, and both bathrooms are. The half bathroom is tiny and not accessible at all, the full bath is spacious but it's a bit tight around the actual toilet.</p>
